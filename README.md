## Preferences

There is a preferences menu that allows to modify the behaviour of the app. This menu includes the following parameters:

**- APIKey:** Key used to authenticate the station in the server. This parameter can't be modified. <br/>
**- Number of intents:** Number of intents the app is allowed to try to upload the data to the server. <br/>
**- Time between intents:** Time in seconds between each upload intent. <br/>
**- Sleep time:** Time in seconds between the start of each execution of the service. <br/>
**- Destroy Audio:** If this parameter is activated, the audio file will be deleted from the device after it's been successfully uploaded to the server.

**NOTE:** Due to the Android version of the devices, alarms were used to send the audios. This makes necessary to change the sleep time with caution because it could make the app to try to upload the same file twice in case there's a slow internet connection and the alarm starts when it's uploading a file.
